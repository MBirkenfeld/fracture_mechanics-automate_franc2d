This is a script to automate franc2d.

# Use at your own risk!

Because image comprehension did not work for me to click buttons, I had to manually enter some coordinates in the script. 
You will have to also manually change them if you want to use this script.

As of now the script only works with 1920x1080 resolution and 150% scaling of windows,
this might change in the future.
