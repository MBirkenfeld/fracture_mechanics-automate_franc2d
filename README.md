# fracture_mechanics-automate_franc2d

# this is a script to automate franc2d 
# use at your own risk!

# because image comprehension did not work for me to click buttons, I had to manually enter some coordinates in the script. 
# you will have to also manually change them if you want to use this script
# as of now the script only works with 1920x1080 resolution, this might change in the future
